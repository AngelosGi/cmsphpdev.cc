# CMS PHP Development Project

This project is a simple content management system (CMS) developed using PHP. It's a part of my learning journey in PHP and MVC architecture.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and is structured as follows:

- `classes/`: Contains the core classes for the application including Bootstrap, Controller, and Model.
- `controllers/`: Contains the controller classes for different sections of the application like home, posts, and users.
- `models/`: Contains the model classes for different sections of the application like home, posts, and users.
- `views/`: Contains the view files for different sections of the application.
- `assets/`: Contains the static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `index.php`: The entry point of the application.

Throughout the development of this project, I learned and implemented the following concepts:

- MVC Architecture: Learned how to structure a project following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
