# CMS PHP Development Project

This project is a simple content management system (CMS) developed using PHP. It's a part of my learning journey in PHP and MVC architecture.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and is structured as follows:

- `classes/`: Contains the core classes for the application including Bootstrap, Controller, and Model.
- `controllers/`: Contains the controller classes for different sections of the application like home, posts, and users.
- `models/`: Contains the model classes for different sections of the application like home, posts, and users.
- `views/`: Contains the view files for different sections of the application.
- `assets/`: Contains the static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `index.php`: The entry point of the application.

## Concepts Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I learned and implemented the following concepts:

- MVC Architecture: Learned how to structure a project following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- PHP OOP: Improved my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP.
- PHP Data Objects (PDO): Learned how to interact with the database using PDO in PHP.
- Front-End Development: Learned how to integrate front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a PHP backend.

## Setup and Run

To set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a local server environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or Laravel Valet) and start the server.
3. Create a database and import the SQL file (if provided).
4. Update the `config.php` file with your database credentials.
5. Open the project in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication.
- Add more features like comments, likes, etc.
- Improve the UI/UX of the application.
